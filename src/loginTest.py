Certainly! Below is a sample test automation script using Playwright and Python for the login process outlined in your request. You need to have Playwright installed in your Python environment to run this script. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

After installing Playwright, you can run the following script named `loginTest.py`.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    # Open the website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', "standard_user")

    # Enter password
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', "secret_sauce")

    # Click on the login button
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

    # Select the logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Close the browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Browser Launching**: The script launches a Chromium browser in non-headless mode (which means you can see the browser's actions).
2. **Navigation**: It navigates to the Sauce Demo website.
3. **Form Filling**: It fills in the username and password using the given XPaths.
4. **Login Click**: It clicks the login button.
5. **Logout Process**: After logging in, it clicks on the hamburger menu and selects the logout option.
6. **Cleanup**: Finally, it closes the browser context and the browser itself.

### Running the Script
To run the `loginTest.py` script, navigate to the directory containing the script in your command line, and run:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

Make sure that you have the Playwright browsers installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
playwright install
```

This command installs the necessary browser binaries that Playwright will use.
