Hereâ€™s the complete Playwright test automation script written in Python, named `loginTest.py`. This script navigates to the SauceDemo website, logs in with the specified credentials, and then logs out. It uses the provided XPaths for the web elements.

Make sure Playwright is installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Now, you can use the following script:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch a browser instance
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without the browser UI
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    try:
        # Step 1: Open the website
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter credentials and log in
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Enter username
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')      # Enter password
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                  # Click the login button

        # Wait for the navigation to complete after logging in
        page.wait_for_navigation()

        # Step 3: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select the logout option
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')        # Click the Hamburger Menu
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')           # Click the Logout option

        # Optionally, validate successful logout
        # Wait for the login button to appear, indicating that the user has logged out
        page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="login-button"]', timeout=5000)  # Timeout after 5 seconds

    finally:
        # Close the browser context and the browser
        context.close()
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with sync_playwright() as playwright:
        run(playwright)
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Imports**: The script imports `sync_playwright` from the Playwright library for synchronous execution.
2. **Launching the Browser**: A Chromium browser is launched, and a new context and page are created. The `headless` parameter can be set to `True` for running without a GUI.
3. **Navigating to the Website**: The script visits the SauceDemo login page.
4. **Login Process**:
   - The username and password fields are filled using the specified XPaths.
   - The login button is clicked, followed by waiting for the page to navigate.
5. **Logout Process**:
   - The script clicks the hamburger menu icon and then the logout link.
   - Optionally, it waits for the login button to become visible again, indicating successful logout.
6. **Cleanup**: The browser context and browser are closed in a `finally` block to ensure they are always shut down properly.

### Running the Script
To run this script, save it in a file named `loginTest.py`, and execute it using the following command:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

This script will perform the automated login and logout process on the SauceDemo website as specified in your instructions. Adjust the `headless` option to see the browser's actions or run it in the background according to your needs.
