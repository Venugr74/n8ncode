Below is a sample test automation script using Playwright and Python named `loginTest.py`, based on the test steps and XPaths you provided:

```python
# loginTest.py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch a new browser instance
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True for headless mode
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()

    try:
        # Step 1: Open website
        await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter username
        await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')

        # Step 3: Enter password
        await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

        # Step 4: Click on the Login button
        await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Step 5: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
        await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

        # Step 6: Select the logout option
        await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        # Optional: Wait for a bit to see the logout action
        await page.wait_for_timeout(2000)

    finally:
        # Close the browser context and browser
        await context.close()
        await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import the necessary modules from the `playwright.async_api`.
2. **Browser Interaction**:
   - A new browser instance is launched.
   - A new context and page are created to interact with.
3. **Automation Steps**:
   - Navigate to the website.
   - Fill in the username and password fields using the provided XPaths.
   - Click the login button to log in.
   - Open the side menu by clicking the hamburger icon and then select the logout option.
4. **Cleanup**: The context and browser are closed in the `finally` block to ensure that resources are properly released.
5. **Entry Point**: The script runs through the `asyncio.run(main())` method for asynchronous execution.

### Note:
- Ensure you have Playwright and the necessary browser environments installed. You can install Playwright and set it up using:
  ```bash
  pip install playwright
  playwright install
  ```
- You can run the script using:
  ```bash
  python loginTest.py
  ```
- Adjust the `headless` parameter in the `launch` method as needed to control whether the browser runs in the background or is visible.
