Below is a simple Playwright test automation script in Python, named `loginTest.py`, which performs the login and logout operations as specified in your request. Before you run the script, ensure that you have Playwright and its dependencies installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Here's the `loginTest.py` script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(login_url):
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # headless=False to see the browser window
        page = await browser.new_page()

        # Step 1: Open the website
        await page.goto(login_url)

        # Step 2: Enter credentials
        await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Fill in the username
        await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')    # Fill in the password

        # Step 3: Click on the login button
        await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Step 4: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
        await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

        # Step 5: Select the logout option
        await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        # Close the browser
        await browser.close()

# URL to be tested
login_url = "https://www.saucedemo.com"
asyncio.run(run(login_url))
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing Necessary Modules**: We import `asyncio` and `async_playwright` to handle asynchronous operations with Playwright.

2. **`run` Function**: This asynchronous function encapsulates the test steps.

3. **Launching the Browser**: We launch a Chromium browser (you could choose Firefox or WebKit as well) and create a new page.

4. **Navigating to the Login Page**: The browser navigates to the specified URL.

5. **Filling in Credentials**: We use the `fill` method to insert the username and password into the appropriate fields using their XPath.

6. **Clicking the Login Button**: The browser clicks the login button after filling in the credentials.

7. **Interacting with the Hamburger Menu**: After logging in, the script clicks on the hamburger menu and selects the logout option.

8. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, the browser is closed once the operations are completed.

### Running the Script

Make sure you execute this script in an environment where you have access to a display (if you're not running it headless) and that you have the necessary dependencies installed. To run the script, simply execute:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

This will run the automated login and logout test for the specified website.
