Certainly! Below is a Python automation script using Playwright to perform the specified login and logout test steps for the Sauce Demo website. Save this script in a file named `loginTest.py`.

Make sure you have Playwright installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Here's the `loginTest.py` script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without UI
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Step 1: Open the website
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Login by entering credentials
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Enter username
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')  # Enter password
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')  # Click the login button

    # Step 3: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and logout
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')  # Click on the hamburger menu
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')  # Click on the logout option

    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Importing Libraries**: The script starts by importing the necessary libraries from `playwright.async_api`.
2. **Browser Launch**: It launches a Chromium browser instance, with the option to view the UI.
3. **Navigating to the URL**: The script navigates to the Sauce Demo login page.
4. **Filling Out the Form**: It fills out the username and password fields using the provided XPaths and clicks the login button.
5. **Logging Out**: After logging in, it clicks on the hamburger menu and selects the logout option.
6. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, it closes the browser.

### Running the Script
You can run the script via terminal or command line:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

This will execute the test automation steps as described. Make sure to have your environment set up properly with Playwright and its dependencies before running the script.
