Below is a sample test automation script for logging into the Sauce Demo website, logging out, and using Playwright with Python. The script is named `loginTest.py` and follows the test steps you provided.

Make sure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

You also need to install the necessary browser binaries:

```bash
playwright install
```

Now you can create the `loginTest.py` file with the following content:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without UI
    page = browser.new_page()
    try:
        # Open the website
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Enter credentials and login
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Wait for navigation after login
        page.wait_for_navigation()

        # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and logout
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        # Wait for navigation after logout
        page.wait_for_navigation()

    finally:
        # Close the browser
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with sync_playwright() as playwright:
        run(playwright)
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Imports**: The script imports `sync_playwright` from Playwright for synchronous control.
2. **Browser Launching**: It launches a Chromium browser in non-headless mode for visibility (you can change to headless mode by setting `headless=True`).
3. **Navigation**: It navigates to the Sauce Demo login page, inputs credentials, and performs login through XPath selectors.
4. **Logging Out**: After login, it clicks the hamburger menu and selects the logout option with appropriate XPaths.
5. **Closing Browser**: Finally, it ensures the browser closes after the actions complete.

### Running the Script:
To execute the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

Ensure that you have a Python environment with Playwright installed, and you should be able to see the automation in action.
