Here's a sample test automation script using Playwright and Python named `loginTest.py`. This script follows the steps you've specified for testing the login functionality and logout process on the Sauce Demo website. Make sure you have Playwright installed and properly set up in your Python environment.

```python
# loginTest.py

import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Start the browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run in background
    page = await browser.new_page()
    
    # Open the Sauce Demo website
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")
    
    # Enter username
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
    
    # Enter password
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
    
    # Click on the Login button
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')
    
    # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
    
    # Select the logout option
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')
    
    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

# Entry point of the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run(async_playwright()))
```

### Instructions to Run the Script

1. **Install Playwright**: If you haven't done so yet, you need to install Playwright in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Save the Script**: Save the above script as `loginTest.py`.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python loginTest.py
   ```

### Notes:

- The script launches a Chromium browser window, navigates to the login page, enters the username and password, clicks the login button, and then logs out of the application.
- You can set `headless=True` in the `launch` method if you want to run the tests without opening a GUI.
- Playwright runs asynchronously, so we're using `async` and `await` keywords throughout the code.
- Adjust the script as necessary based on your testing framework or specific requirements.
