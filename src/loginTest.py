Here is a simple test automation script named `loginTest.py` using Playwright and Python, which follows the steps you provided. Make sure you have the necessary Playwright library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Also, you need to install the browser binaries by running:

```bash
playwright install
```

Below is the content of `loginTest.py`:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without UI
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()
    
    # Open the website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")
    
    # Enter credentials and login
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', "standard_user")  # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', "secret_sauce")     # Enter password
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                 # Click on login button
    
    # Click on Hamburger Menu Icon
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')        # Click on the side bar/menu icon
    
    # Select logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')          # Click on logout button
    
    # Close the browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

# Run the function using Playwright
with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### How to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the script above in a file named `loginTest.py`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

### Notes:
- The `headless` parameter in `launch()` is set to `False` to allow you to see the browser actions. You can set it to `True` to run the tests without UI for faster execution.
- Make sure the URLs and element identifiers remain valid as per the current structure of the website. You may need to adjust the XPaths if the website structure changes.
- You can customize error handling and add assertions based on your testing requirements.
