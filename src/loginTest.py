Below is a Playwright test automation script in Python named `loginTest.py`. This script will perform the required test steps as specified, including logging into the website, and then logging out by using the provided XPaths.

Make sure you have Playwright installed and set up in your Python environment. You can install Playwright using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Then, you can run the Playwright install command to install the necessary browser binaries:

```bash
playwright install
```

Hereâ€™s the `loginTest.py` script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch a browser instance
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run in headless mode
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    # Step 1: Open the website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Enter credentials and login
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')      # Enter password
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                  # Click on the login button

    # Step 3: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select logout
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')        # Click on the Hamburger Menu
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')           # Click on the logout option

    # Optionally, you can add assertions here to verify successful logout,
    # such as checking the URL or the visibility of the login button after a successful logout.

    # Close the browser context and the browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation of the Script:
- The script initializes the Playwright library and launches a Chromium browser instance.
- It navigates to the SauceDemo website, fills in the username and password fields using the provided XPaths, and clicks the login button.
- After logging in, it clicks on the hamburger menu icon and then on the logout button.
- Finally, it closes the browser context and the browser instance.

### Usage
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

This will perform the automated login and logout process as described in the test steps. Adjust the `headless` parameter as per your needs for visual confirmation during development or testing.
