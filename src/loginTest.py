Certainly! Below is a sample test automation script using Playwright and Python named `loginTest.py`. This script performs the specified steps to log in to the Sauce Demo website, and then logs out.

Please ensure you have Playwright installed and the necessary browsers set up. You can install Playwright using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Here's the content of `loginTest.py`:

```python
import time
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    # Step 1: Open website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Click on the Login button and enter credentials
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')    # Enter password
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                # Click login button

    # Wait for navigation after login
    page.wait_for_navigation()

    # Step 3: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select the logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')           # Click Hamburger Menu
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')              # Click logout option

    # Wait for navigation after logout
    page.wait_for_navigation()

    # Close browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation:
- The script uses the Playwright library to automate the browser interactions.
- It opens the Sauce Demo website, inputs the username and password, and logs in.
- After successful login, it clicks on the hamburger menu icon, then selects the logout option.
- The browser context is created with `headless=False` so you can see the actions being performed. You can change it to `True` for headless mode.
- The script waits for navigation where necessary to ensure actions are completed before proceeding to the next step.
  
### Running the Script:
You can run your script with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python loginTest.py
```

This will execute the automated login and logout steps as defined in your request. Make sure to adjust any timing or waits if necessary based on the performance of your local environment.
