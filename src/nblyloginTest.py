Here is a basic automation test script using Playwright and Python based on your requirements. To run this script, make sure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

After installing Playwright, you need to install the browser binaries as well. You can do this with:

```bash
playwright install
```

Now you can create the `nblyloginTest.py` file with the following code:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run_playwright_test():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to not see the browser
        # Open a new browser context
        context = browser.new_context()
        # Open a new page
        page = context.new_page()

        # Step 1: Navigate to the URL
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter Username
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')

        # Step 3: Enter Password
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

        # Step 4: Click on Login Button
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Verify Login Success (optional)
        page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="add-to-cart-sauce-labs-bike-light"]')
        
        # Step 5: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

        # Step 6: Select Logout Option
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        # Close browser context and browser
        context.close()
        browser.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_playwright_test()
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Importing Libraries**: The script begins with importing `sync_playwright` from the Playwright package.
- **Running the Test**: The function `run_playwright_test` encapsulates the test logic.
- **Launching the Browser**: The browser is launched in non-headless mode (you can change `headless=False` to `headless=True` to run it without opening the browser UI).
- **Navigating to the Website**: The script goes to the provided URL.
- **Filling Credentials**: It fills in the username and password by using the given XPath.
- **Clicking Login**: It clicks the login button.
- **Verifying Successful Login (Optional)**: After login, it waits for an element on the homepage to confirm that the login was successful.
- **Navigating to Logout**: The script opens the hamburger menu and clicks on the logout button.
- **Closing the Browser**: Finally, it closes the browser context and the browser itself.

### Tips for Running the Script:

1. Make sure you have Playwright installed and the necessary browsers installed by running `playwright install`.
2. Save the above code in a file named `nblyloginTest.py`.
3. Run the script using the command:

```bash
python nblyloginTest.py
```

This will execute the defined automation test steps and should log you into the website before logging you out.
