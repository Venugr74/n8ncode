Here’s a complete Playwright test automation script in Python that implements the steps you specified for logging into the Sauce Demo website and logging out afterward. This script uses the provided XPath selectors for interacting with UI elements.

First, ensure you have Playwright installed as mentioned previously. Then, you can create and run the following script.

### Test Automation Script

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch Chromium browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without UI
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    # Open Sauce Demo website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Login process
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Optional: Wait for navigation or check for successful login
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')  # Check for the presence of menu button
    
    # Click the Hamburger Menu Icon on top left
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
    
    # Select the logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Optional: Wait for confirmation of logout
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="login-button"]')  # Check if the login button is back, indicating logout successful

    # Close the browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules from Playwright are imported.
2. **Browser Launch**: A Chromium browser instance is launched. Change `headless=False` to `headless=True` if you don’t want to see the UI during the execution.
3. **Navigate to URL**: The script navigates to the given Sauce Demo website.
4. **Login Steps**:
   - Fills the username and password using the provided XPath.
   - Clicks the login button to submit the credentials.
   - An optional step is included that waits for the Hamburger Menu icon to appear, indicating a successful login.
5. **Logout Steps**:
   - Clicks on the Hamburger Menu icon.
   - Clicks the logout button to log out of the application.
   - Another optional step checks for the presence of the login button again to confirm that the logout was successful.
6. **Cleanup**: The context and browser are closed.

### Running the Script
- Save the code to a file named `saucedemo_test.py`.
- Execute the script using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python saucedemo_test.py
```

### Additional Comments
- You might want to add assertions or logging to validate that each step was successful.
- Depending on your testing needs, you could also expand this test to include navigating to a product page, adding items to the cart, and going through the checkout process using the other elements' XPaths you provided. 
- Make sure your Python environment is set up properly and Playwright is installed correctly.
