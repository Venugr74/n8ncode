Here is a complete test automation script using Playwright and Python, named `loginTest.py`. This script will perform the specified actions for logging into the SauceDemo website and then logging out.

```python
# loginTest.py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Step 1: Launch the browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Headless mode can be set to True if desired
    page = browser.new_page()

    # Step 2: Open the Sauce Demo website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 3: Enter username and password, then click login
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')    # Enter password
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                # Click on the login button

    # Step 4: Wait for the home page to load (wait for hamburger menu)
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

    # Step 5: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon to open the menu
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')      # Click on the Hamburger Menu

    # Step 6: Select logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')         # Click on the Logout button

    # Optional: Wait for the login button to ensure logout was successful
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Step 7: Close the browser
    browser.close()

# Run the Playwright test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with sync_playwright() as playwright:
        run(playwright)
```

### Script Breakdown
1. **Imports**: The script imports `sync_playwright` from Playwright's library to enable synchronous API calls.
  
2. **Browser Initialization**: The script launches a Chromium browser instance. You can set `headless=True` to run tests in the background without a UI.

3. **Navigation to the Site**: The script navigates to the Sauce Demo login page.

4. **Login Step**: Using the provided XPaths, it fills the username and password fields with values `"standard_user"` and `"secret_sauce"`, respectively, and clicks the login button.

5. **Post-login Verification**: The script waits for the hamburger menu icon to be visible, indicating that the login was successful.

6. **Logout Process**: After logging in, it clicks the hamburger menu icon and then clicks the logout button in the sidebar.

7. **Verification of Logout**: Optionally, it waits for the login button element to ensure the user has successfully logged out.

8. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, the script closes the browser.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Playwright**:
   Ensure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment:

   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python loginTest.py
   ```

Make sure your Python environment is correctly set up and you're running it from a location where this script is saved. Adjustments can be made if you want to include additional assertions or operations based on your testing needs.
