Here's a Playwright test automation script in Python named `newurlTest.py` that follows the test steps you provided:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch a new browser instance
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Step 1: Open website
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Click on the Login button and enter credentials
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

    # Step 3: Login
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Wait for navigation after login
    await page.wait_for_navigation()

    # Step 4: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select logout option
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')  # Click hamburger menu
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')     # Click logout button

    # Wait for a moment before closing (optional)
    await asyncio.sleep(2)

    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

# Entry point for the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The script starts by importing the necessary modules from Playwright.
2. **Browser Launch**: It then launches a Chromium browser instance.
3. **Navigation**: The script navigates to the specified URL and fills in the username and password fields using the provided XPaths.
4. **Login Action**: After entering the credentials, it clicks the login button and waits for the navigation to complete.
5. **Logout Action**: Once logged in, it clicks the hamburger menu icon and then the logout button.
6. **Close Browser**: After a brief pause, it will close the browser.

### Execution:
To run this test, make sure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install playwright
```
After installing Playwright, you also need to install the browsers by running:
```bash
playwright install
```

To execute your script, save the code in a file named `newurlTest.py`, and run the script using:
```bash
python newurlTest.py
```

Make sure that you have the necessary execution permissions depending on your operating system and your Python environment is properly configured.
