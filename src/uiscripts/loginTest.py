Here is a sample automation test script using Playwright and Python for the test steps you've described. The script is named `loginTest.py` and it encapsulates the provided test steps and XPaths.

```python
# loginTest.py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run_login_test():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        
        # Open the website
        await page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com')
        
        # Enter username
        await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
        
        # Enter password
        await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
        
        # Click Login button
        await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')
        
        # Wait for navigation
        await page.wait_for_navigation()
        
        # Click on Hamburger Menu Icon
        await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        
        # Click on logout option
        await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')
        
        # Close the browser
        await browser.close()

# Entry point for the script
if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(run_login_test())
```

### Instructions to Run the Script

1. **Install Playwright**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. First, install Playwright using pip:

   ```
   pip install playwright
   ```

   Then, install the necessary browsers:

   ```
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Save the Code**: Copy the above code into a file named `loginTest.py`.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script from your command line:

   ```bash
   python loginTest.py
   ```

### Explanation of the Script

- The script uses the `async` and `await` keywords for asynchronous operations provided by Playwright.
- The browser is launched in a non-headless mode (`headless=False`), so you can see the actions performed during the test.
- The script automates the interaction with the login page by filling in the username and password, clicking the login button, and then logging out through the hamburger menu.
- It closes the browser after the operations are done to free up resources. 

Feel free to customize or expand the script as needed for more complex testing scenarios or additional functionalities!
