Certainly! Below is a sample test automation script using Playwright and Python for the specified test scenario. This script is named `loginTest.py` and will execute the login workflow, and then log out from the application.

Make sure you have Playwright installed along with its dependencies. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so already:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Here is the `loginTest.py` script:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run_login_test():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Start a browser instance
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Step 1: Open the website
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")
        
        # Step 2: Enter username
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
        
        # Step 3: Enter password
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
        
        # Step 4: Click on the Login button
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')
        
        # Step 5: Wait for the page to load
        page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        
        # Step 6: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        
        # Step 7: Click on the logout button
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')
        
        # Step 8: Verify that we have logged out (for example checking login button presence)
        page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Close the browser
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_login_test()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Playwright:** The script starts by importing the necessary module from Playwright.
2. **Browser Launching:** It initializes a Chromium browser instance. Set `headless=True` if you prefer to run it without a UI.
3. **Navigating to the Website:** The test navigates to Sauce Demo's login page.
4. **Filling in Credentials:** The script fills in the username and password using the provided XPath elements.
5. **Logging In:** It then clicks the login button.
6. **Navigating to Logout:** After logging in, it clicks on the hamburger menu and then the logout button.
7. **Confirmation of Logout:** Finally, it checks for the presence of the login button to confirm the logout action.
8. **Closing the Browser:** The browser is closed at the end of the test.

### Notes:
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and that your environment is set up for Playwright.
- To run the script, simply execute it with Python (`python loginTest.py`).
- You may need to adjust the script based on additional test requirement specifics or validations you want to perform.
