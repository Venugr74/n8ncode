Here is a Python script named `debugTest.py` that automates the login and logout process on the Sauce Demo website using Playwright:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    # Open a new browser context and page
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()
    
    try:
        # Step 1: Navigate to the Sauce Demo website
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Locate and fill in the username
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')

        # Step 3: Locate and fill in the password
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
        
        # Step 4: Click the login button
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Step 5: Click the Hamburger Menu Icon
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        
        # Step 6: Select the logout option
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        print("Successfully logged out.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    finally:
        # Close the browser context and browser
        context.close()
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with sync_playwright() as playwright:
        run(playwright)
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Importing Playwright**: We import the necessary `sync_playwright` class from playwright.

2. **Launch the Browser**: We create a Chromium browser instance and set `headless=False` so you can see the actions being performed.

3. **Navigate to the URL**: We use `page.goto` to navigate to the specified website.

4. **Fill in Username and Password**: The `page.fill` method is used to input the username and password using their respective XPaths.

5. **Click the Login Button**: We click the login button using its XPath.

6. **Navigate the Menu and Logout**: We click the Hamburger Menu Icon and then the logout option using their XPaths.

7. **Error Handling**: In case of any errors during execution, the catch block will print the error message.

8. **Cleanup**: The browser context and browser are closed in the `finally` block to ensure resources are cleaned up.

### Running the Script:
To run the script, ensure that you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Also, make sure to install the necessary browsers by running:

```bash
playwright install
```

You can then run the script using:

```bash
python debugTest.py
```

This script will open the Sauce Demo website, perform the login and logout actions, and print a success message.
