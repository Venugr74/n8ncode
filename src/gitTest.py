Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script using Playwright that automates the login, logout, and a few actions on the specified website. This script is named `gitTest.py`.

```python
# gitTest.py

import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()

    # Open the website
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")
    
    # Enter credentials and login
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select logout
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

# Main method
async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

# Entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Notes:

1. **Playwright Installation**: Ensure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Running the Script**: To run the script, you simply execute:
   ```bash
   python gitTest.py
   ```

3. **Headless Mode**: The `headless=False` option allows you to see the browser actions. If you want it to run without opening a browser window, change it to `True`.

4. **Asynchronous Execution**: The Playwright library uses asynchronous calls, hence the use of `async` and `await`.

5. **XPath Selection**: The script uses the XPaths you provided to locate elements on the webpage.

Feel free to modify the script to cover additional functionalities or to better fit your specific needs!
