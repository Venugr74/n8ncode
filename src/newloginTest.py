Below is a Python test automation script using Playwright that follows the steps you provided. This script is saved as `newloginTest.py` and automates the login process on the Sauce Demo website, followed by logging out.

Make sure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Then, you can install the necessary browsers by running:

```bash
playwright install
```

Hereâ€™s the `newloginTest.py` script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run_login_test():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without a UI
        page = await browser.new_page()
        
        # Step 1: Open the website
        await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter credentials
        await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
        await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

        # Step 3: Click on the Login button
        await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Verify successful login
        assert await page.title() == "Swag Labs"

        # Step 4: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select the logout option
        await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')  # Click on Hamburger Menu
        await page.click('text=Logout')  # Click on Logout option

        # Close the browser
        await browser.close()

# Run the test
asyncio.run(run_login_test())
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: The script starts by importing the required libraries from Playwright.
2. **Launching the Browser**: It launches the Chromium browser in non-headless mode (with a UI) for visibility during tests.
3. **Navigating to the URL**: The script goes to the specified website.
4. **Filling in the Login Form**: It uses XPath to fill in the username and password fields.
5. **Clicking Login**: After entering credentials, the script clicks the login button.
6. **Assertion**: It checks whether the title of the page is as expected after login.
7. **Logging Out**: Then it clicks the hamburger menu button and selects the logout option.
8. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, the script closes the browser.

### Running the Script:
You can run this script from the command line using:

```bash
python newloginTest.py
```

### Note:
- Adjust the XPath locators in the script if the structure of the website changes.
- Ensure that your Playwright setup is correctly done as per environment requirements.
