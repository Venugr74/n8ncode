Below is the sample automation script using Playwright and Python, named `newloginTest.py`. This script will perform the steps you outlined, including opening the Sauce Demo website, logging in with the provided credentials, and logging out afterwards.

### Script: `newloginTest.py`

```python
# newloginTest.py

import asyncio
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(login_user, login_pass):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser (set headless to True for background running)
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        
        # Create a new browser context
        page = browser.new_page()

        # Step 1: Open Sauce Demo website
        page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter username
        page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', login_user)
        
        # Step 3: Enter password
        page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', login_pass)
        
        # Step 4: Click on the login button
        page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')
        
        # Wait for the page to load before interacting with the menu
        page.wait_for_timeout(2000)  # waits for 2 seconds

        # Step 5: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
        page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        
        # Step 6: Select the logout option
        page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

        # Optional: Wait to observe the logout action
        page.wait_for_timeout(2000)  # wait for 2 seconds

        # Close the browser
        browser.close()

# Run the test with the specified credentials
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run("standard_user", "secret_sauce")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Libraries**: The script uses Playwright's synchronous API.
2. **Function Declaration**: The `run` function is defined to encapsulate the test steps.
3. **Browser Launch**: The Chromium browser is launched. You may adjust `headless=False` for visual feedback during development or set it to `True` for running tests in the background.
4. **Page Interaction**:
   - The script navigates to the Sauce Demo login page.
   - It fills in the username and password fields using the provided XPaths.
   - After logging in, it waits briefly for the page to load before interacting with the hamburger menu.
   - It selects the logout option from the menu.
5. **Final Actions**: Optionally, the script waits briefly to observe the logout and then closes the browser.
6. **Execution**: The `run` function is executed with the standard user credentials when the script is run directly.

### Running the Script
To execute the script, save it as `newloginTest.py` and run it from your command line as follows:

```bash
python newloginTest.py
```

This will open the Sauce Demo page, perform the login, and then log out, following the specified steps provided. Make sure you have Playwright installed and set up correctly in your environment.
