Below is a Python script for an automation test using Playwright. This script automates the login and logout process for the website `https://www.saucedemo.com`, based on the provided test steps and XPaths.

### `loginTest2.py`

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.new_context()

    # Open new browser page
    page = await context.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Enter username
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')

    # Enter password
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

    # Click on the login button
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

    # Select the logout option
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Close browser context
    await context.close()
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Instructions to Run the Script

1. **Install Playwright**: If you haven't already, you need to install Playwright. You can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Save the Script**: Save the code above in a file named `loginTest2.py`.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script using Python from your command line or terminal:
   ```bash
   python loginTest2.py
   ```

### Important Notes

- This script uses asynchronous capabilities of Playwright and Python. Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher.
- The `headless` mode is set to `False` to allow you to see the browser actions. You can change it to `True` if you want to run it in headless mode (without opening a browser window).
- The script assumes that the website is accessible when you run it. If there are any changes to the website or the elements, the XPaths may need to be updated accordingly.
