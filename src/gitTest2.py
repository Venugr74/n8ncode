Certainly! Below is a simple automation script using Playwright with Python, named `gitTest2.py`, that follows the specified test steps.

```python
# gitTest2.py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()

    try:
        # Step 1: Open the website
        await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

        # Step 2: Enter username and password, then login
        await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')
        await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')
        await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

        # Step 3: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select the logout option
        await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')
        await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    finally:
        # Close the browser
        await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Overview of the Script:
1. **Imports**: The script imports the necessary modules for using Playwright.
2. **`run` Function**: 
   - It launches a Chromium browser instance.
   - Navigates to the specified website (`https://www.saucedemo.com`).
   - Fills in the username and password fields using the provided XPaths and clicks the login button.
   - After logging in, it clicks the hamburger menu and selects the logout option.
3. **Error Handling**: The `try`/`finally` block ensures that the browser closes properly regardless of success or failure during execution.
4. **Main Function**: The entry point of the script, which initializes Playwright and runs the `run` function.

### Installation:
To run this script, you will need to have Python and Playwright installed. You can install Playwright using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

### Running the Script:
Save the script as `gitTest2.py` and run it in your terminal:

```bash
python gitTest2.py
```

This script will open a Chromium browser, perform the login and logout sequence as specified, and then close the browser. Make sure to adjust the script if you have any additional error handling or configurations in mind!
