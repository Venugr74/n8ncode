Here’s a Playwright test automation script in Python following your specifications. The script is named `caTest2.py` and covers the steps you provided for testing the login and logout functionality on the SauceDemo website.

Make sure you have Playwright installed. You can install it using pip if you haven’t done so already:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Here’s the script:

```python
# caTest2.py

import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    # Launch browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()

    # Step 1: Open SauceDemo website
    await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Click on the Login button and enter credentials
    await page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')    # Enter username
    await page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')      # Enter password
    await page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')                 # Click login button

    # Step 3: After login, click on the Hamburger Menu Icon and select logout option
    await page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')        # Click Hamburger Menu
    await page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')          # Click logout option

    # Close browser
    await context.close()
    await browser.close()

asyncio.run(run(async_playwright()))
```

### Explanation of the Steps:

1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary modules from Playwright for async operations.

2. **Browser Launch**: It launches a Chromium browser instance. The `headless` option is set to `False` so you can see the browser interactions. Change it to `True` to run without a UI.

3. **Navigating to the Website**: The script navigates to the provided URL.

4. **Filling Credentials**: It fills in the username and password using the specified XPath selectors and clicks the login button.

5. **Logging Out**: After logging in, it clicks on the hamburger menu icon and then the logout option.

6. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, it closes the context and the browser.

### Running the Script

You can run the script using Python:

```bash
python caTest2.py
```

This should execute the automated test that logs in with the specified credentials and then logs out. Adjust the `headless` parameter as needed to see the browser in action or to run it in the background.
