Certainly! Below is a test automation script using Playwright with Python that implements the test steps you provided for logging into the SauceDemo website, then logging out. The script is named `tmloginTest.py`. 

Before running this script, make sure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Now, here is the `tmloginTest.py` script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch the browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True if you don't want a UI.
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

    # Open the SauceDemo website
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Enter username
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')

    # Enter password
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')

    # Click the login button
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')

    # Wait for the products page to load
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="add-to-cart-sauce-labs-bike-light"]')

    # Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

    # Select the logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Optional: Verify logout by checking if we are back at the login page
    page.wait_for_selector('//*[@id="user-name"]')

    # Close the browser
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Setting Up the Script**: The script uses the synchronous API of Playwright.
2. **Launching the Browser**: It launches a Chromium browser and opens a new context.
3. **Navigating to the Website**: It goes to `https://www.saucedemo.com`.
4. **Filling in Credentials**: The script fills in the username and password fields using the given XPaths.
5. **Login Action**: It clicks the login button.
6. **Waiting for the Products Page**: It waits for a specific element on the products page to ensure successful login.
7. **Logout Procedure**: It opens the menu and logs out.
8. **Verification**: It waits for the username field to ensure we are back on the login page after logout.
9. **Closing the Browser**: Finally, it closes the browser.

To execute this script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python tmloginTest.py
```

Make sure your environment is set up properly and that you have the necessary Playwright dependencies. Adjust the `headless` parameter in `launch()` as needed depending on whether you want to see the browser UI during the test execution.
