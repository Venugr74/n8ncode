You can create a test automation script using Playwright and Python based on your provided steps. Below is an example script named `newTest.py` that follows the steps outlined in your request.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    # Launch a browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to run without GUI
    context = browser.new_context()
    
    # Open a new page
    page = context.new_page()
    
    # Step 1: Open the website https://www.saucedemo.com
    page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")

    # Step 2: Click on the Login button and enter credentials
    page.fill('//*[@id="user-name"]', 'standard_user')  # Fill in the username
    page.fill('//*[@id="password"]', 'secret_sauce')     # Fill in the password
    
    # Step 3: Click the login button
    page.click('//*[@id="login-button"]')
    
    # Wait for navigation after logging in
    page.wait_for_navigation()

    # Step 4: Click on the Hamburger Menu Icon on top left
    page.click('//*[@id="react-burger-menu-btn"]')

    # Step 5: Select the logout option
    page.click('//*[@id="logout_sidebar_link"]')

    # Wait for the page to be redirected to the login page
    page.wait_for_navigation()

    # Optional: Verify the title or URL to ensure the logout was successful
    assert page.url == "https://www.saucedemo.com/"
    assert page.title() == "Swag Labs"

    # Close the browser
    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Playwright**: The script begins by importing the required module from Playwright.
2. **Setup Browser**: A Chromium browser instance is launched. It can be set to run in headless mode.
3. **Open the Website**: The script navigates to `https://www.saucedemo.com`.
4. **Fill in Credentials**: It uses the provided XPaths to fill in the login form.
5. **Login**: The script clicks the login button and waits for navigation to finish.
6. **Hamburger Menu & Logout**: The script interacts with the hamburger menu to log out.
7. **Verification**: After logging out, the script checks if the page URL and title are as expected.
8. **Cleanup**: Finally, it closes the context and browser.

### Usage:
- Save this script as `newTest.py`.
- Ensure you have Playwright installed in your Python environment:
  ```bash
  pip install playwright
  playwright install
  ```
- Run the script using:
  ```bash
  python newTest.py
  ```

Remember to adjust the headless option as needed during runtime to observe the interactions visually or run it in the background.
