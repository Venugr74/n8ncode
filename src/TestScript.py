 To create an automated UI test using Python and Playwright, follow the steps below:

1. First, make sure you have installed Playwright for your project if not done yet:

```
pip install playwright
```

2. Create a folder named `src`, and inside it create another folder called `pages`. In the pages folder, create a file named `login_page.py`. Here's a sample of how to implement the LoginPage class and login method:

```python
from playwright.async_api import Page

class LoginPage:
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page

    async def go(self):
        await self.page.goto('http://your-website.com/login')

    async def login(self):
        # Fill in the username and password input fields and click the login button
        # Replace the selectors with the appropriate ones for your website
        await self.page.fill('#username_input', 'your-username')
        await self.page.fill('#password_input', 'your-password')
        await self.page.click('#login_button')

    # Add more methods if needed, such as verify_login method to check that the user is logged in
```

3. Create a file named `TestScript.py` inside the src folder:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, browser, context
from pages.login_page import LoginPage

async def test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright):
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.newContext()

    # Use the login page class to log in to the website
    page = LoginPage(context.newPage())
    await page.go()
    await page.login()

    # Wait for the Feature Store Icon to be visible
    await context.wait_for_selector('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')

    # Click on the Feature Store Icon
    feature_store_icon = await context.query_selector('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')
    await feature_store_icon.click()

    # Wait for the Feature Store Text to be visible and click it
    await context.wait_for_selector("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']")
    await context.query_selector("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']").click()

    # Wait for the Launch Feature Job button to be visible
    await context.wait_for_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')

    # Click on the Launch Feature Job Button
    launch_feature_job = await context.query_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')
    await launch_feature_job.click()

    # Wait for the Job Selector button to be visible
    await context.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")

    # Verify that the Job Selector button is visible
    job_selector = await context.query_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")
    assert job_selector is not None, "Job Selector button is not visible"

    await browser.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    playwright = Playwright.create_default_include_devtools()
    asyncio.run(test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright))
```

Adjust the selectors, URLs, and login credentials according to your web application's structure. Run the script using:

```
python src/TestScript.py
```

This script will launch the browser in a non-headless mode, navigate to your website, log in, click the Feature Store Icon, Feature Store Text, and wait for the Launch Feature Job button to be visible before clicking it. Finally, it waits for the Job Selector button to appear and verifies that it's visible on the page. If the script can't find the button, it will fail with an assertion error.
