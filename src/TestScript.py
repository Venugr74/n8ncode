 Here's a basic structure for your test script `TestScript.py` in the specified path `src/TestScript.py`. I'll provide you with a Playwright-based automated UI test using Python and incorporate the given elements and functions. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies (Playwright) before running this script.

```python
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, browser, page, expect
import time

# pages.py file should contain your LoginPage class with the login method
from pages import LoginPage

async def test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright: Playwright):
    # Initialize a new browser instance
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Navigate to the web application login page
    await page.goto('http://your-web-application-url.com/login')

    # Call the login method from LoginPage class
    await LoginPage(page).login()

    # Click on the Feature Store Icon
    await page.click("span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG")
    await page.wait_for_selector("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']")
    await page.click("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store'")]

    # Wait for the Launch Feature Job button to be visible and click on it
    await page.wait_for_selector("(//button[normalize-space()=\"Launch Feature Job\"])[1]")
    await page.click("(//button[normalize-space()=\"Launch Feature Job\"])[1]")

    # Wait for the Job Selector button to be visible and verify its visibility
    await page.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")
    element = await page.$x("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")
    expect(element).to_be_visible()

    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    playwright = Playwright.create_default()
    test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright)
```

In this example, I've created a function `test_forecast_explorer_ui` that takes a Playwright instance as an argument. This function uses the Playwright API to launch a browser, navigate to the login page, log in using the provided method, and perform various actions on the Feature Store webpage (clicking icons and waiting for elements). The script waits for each element to be visible before clicking or interacting with it, and verifies the visibility of the Job Selector button after launching a feature job.

Don't forget to import your `pages.py` file containing the LoginPage class and the login method at the beginning of the script. Make sure that the given element selectors are correct according to your web application's structure, as well as the URL for the login page.
