 Here's a basic structure for your `TestScript.py` file in the given directory (`src/TestScript.py`). I've used the `playwright-python` library to write an automated UI test:

```python
import playwright
from pages.login_page import LoginPage

def test_forecast_explorer_ui():
    # Initialize a new browser instance
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.new_context()

    # Navigate to the login page
    login_page = LoginPage(context)
    login_page.go_to()  # This line assumes that the go_to method navigates to the login page

    # Login using your authentication flow
    login_page.login()

    # Select the first frame if there are multiple frames on the page
    context.frame_by_index(0)

    # Click the Feature Store Icon
    context.get_by_css("span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG").click()

    # Click the Feature Store Text
    context.get_by_xpath("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']").click()

    # Wait for Launch Feature Job button to be visible and click it
    context.wait_for_selector("(//button[normalize-space()='Launch Feature Job'])[1]").first().click()

    # Wait for the Job Selector button to be visible
    context.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")

    # Verify that the Job Selector button is visible
    context.get_by_css("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq").is_visible()

    # Close the browser
    browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_forecast_explorer_ui()
```

Note that you'll need to implement the `LoginPage` class and its methods (`go_to` and `login`) according to your application's login functionality. Also, you may want to add additional assertions or checks depending on your specific use case.

Before running this script, make sure you have the playwright library installed:

```bash
pip install playwright
```
