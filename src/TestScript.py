 Here's a basic structure of the `TestScript.py` file in the specified path:

```python
# src/TestScript.py

import time
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, async_playwright
from pages.login_page import LoginPage

async def test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright: Playwright):
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.newContext()

    # Navigate to the login page and log in
    login_page = LoginPage(context)
    await login_page.navigate()
    await login_page.login()

    # Click Feature Store Icon
    await context.click('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')
    await context.wait_for_selector('span[normalize-space()="Feature Store"]')

    # Click Feature Store Text
    await context.click('//span[normalize-space()="Feature Store"]')

    # Wait for Launch Feature Job button to visible
    launch_feature_job_button = await context.wait_for_selector(
        "(//button[normalize-space()='Launch Feature Job'])[1]"
    )

    # Click on Launch Feature Job Button
    await launch_feature_job_button.click()

    # Wait for Job Selector button to visible
    job_selector = await context.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")

    # Verify the Job Selector button is visible
    assert job_selector is not None

    # Wait for some time (to ensure all elements have loaded)
    time.sleep(5)

    await browser.close()

async def main():
    playwright = await async_playwright.start()
    await test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script assumes you have a `pages/login_page.py` file that has the login method and other required methods for interacting with the login page. The structure of `pages/login_page.py` will depend on how your application is built, but it should include classes for navigating to pages and handling various interactions like login.
