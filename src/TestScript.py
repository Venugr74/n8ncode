 Here's an example of how you could write an automated UI test using Python, Playwright, and a `BasePage` class to verify the functionality of a "Model Store" section in your web application:

Firstly, let's create a `base_page.py` file that will contain our base page class:

```python
from playwright.async_api import Page

class BasePage:
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page

    async def navigate(self, url):
        await self.page.goto(url)

    async def login(self, username, password):
        await self.page.click('#button:has-text("Sign in with AzureAD")')
        await self.page.fill('#i0116', username)
        await self.page.fill('#i0118', password)
        await self.page.click('#idSIButton9')

    def assert_model_store_displayed(self):
        # Add your custom assertion here to check if the Model Store section is displayed
        pass
```

Next, create a new test file (e.g., `test_model_store.py`) to implement our test:

```python
import pytest
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, launch
from base_page import BasePage

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def browser():
    browser = await launch(headless=True)
    yield browser
    await browser.close()

class TestModelStore:
    async def test_model_store(self, browser):
        page = await browser.new_page()
        base_page = BasePage(page)
        await base_page.navigate('http://your-web-application-url')
        await base_page.login('testuser@example.com', 'testpassword')
        await base_page.assert_model_store_displayed()
```

In this example, we define a test function `test_model_store` that navigates to the page, logs in using provided credentials, and asserts that the Model Store section is displayed. You should implement your custom assertion for checking if the Model Store section is displayed within the `assert_model_store_displayed()` method of the `BasePage` class.

To run the test, you can use pytest:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # assuming you have a requirements.txt file with Playwright dependencies
$ pytest test_model_store.py
```

Ensure that your web application URL is updated in the test code, and you can adjust username, password, and Model Store related XPaths as necessary. This example uses good coding practices with meaningful variable names and includes a fixture to manage the browser lifecycle. The browser will be closed at the end of each test by default since we are using pytest's scope setting.
