 Here's a basic structure of the TestScript.py file in the given directory `src/TestScript.py`. I assume you have already set up Playwright and imported necessary modules. Also, I'm assuming that you have the LoginPage class with the login method defined elsewhere in your project.

```python
import time
from pages import LoginPage
import playwright.async_api as async_playwright

async def test_forecast_explorer_ui():
    browser = await async_playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.newContext()

    # Login to the website
    login_page = LoginPage(context)
    await login_page.go_to_login_page()
    await login_page.login()  # Assuming that the login method is implemented and doesn't take any arguments

    # Navigate to Feature Store
    await context.goto('https://your-website.com/feature-store')

    # Click on Feature Store Icon and Text
    await context.click('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')  # Feature Store Icon
    await context.click("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']")  # Feature Store Text

    # Wait for Launch Feature Job button to be visible
    await context.wait_for_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')

    # Click on Launch Feature Job Button
    launch_feature_job_button = await context.query_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')
    await launch_feature_job_button.click()

    # Wait for Job Selector button to be visible
    await context.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")  # Job Selector

    # Verify that the Job Selector button is visible
    job_selector = await context.query_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")
    assert job_selector is not None, "Job Selector button is not visible"

    await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_forecast_explorer_ui())
```

This script will launch a non-headless browser, login to the given website (assuming you have implemented the LoginPage class and its methods), navigate to the Feature Store page, click on the Feature Store Icon and Text, wait for the Launch Feature Job button, click on it, wait for the Job Selector, verify that the Job Selector is visible, and finally close the browser.

Remember to replace `'https://your-website.com/feature-store'` with the actual URL of your web application. Also, make sure you have defined the login method in your LoginPage class appropriately.
