 Here's an example of how you could structure your `TestScript.py` file using Playwright in Python. I've created the necessary classes and functions based on your requirements. Make sure to have `playwright` installed before running this script.

```python
import time
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, async_playwright

# src/pages/login_page.py
class LoginPage:
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page

    @staticmethod
    async def login():
        # Implement your login logic here
        pass

# src/TestScript.py
import sys
from src.pages.login_page import LoginPage

async def on_login(playwright: Playwright):
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = await browser.newContext()
    page = await context.newPage()

    # Navigate to the application and login
    await LoginPage.login(page)

async def test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright: Playwright):
    # Launch the browser and navigate to the application
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = await browser.newPage()

    await on_login(browser, page)

    # Wait for the Feature Store Icon to be visible
    await page.wait_for_selector(".sc-irPVuy.fYDalG")

    # Click the Feature Store Icon
    await page.click(".sc-irPVuy.fYDalG")

    # Click the Feature Store Text
    await page.click("//span[normalize-space()='Feature Store']")

    # Wait for the Launch Feature Job button to be visible
    await page.wait_for_selector("(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]")

    # Click on the Launch Feature Job Button
    launch_feature_job = await page.$x("(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]")
    await launch_feature_job[0].click()

    # Wait for the Job Selector button to be visible
    await page.wait_for_selector("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")

    # Verify the Job Selector button is visible
    job_selector = await page.$x("button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq")
    assert len(job_selector) > 0, "Job Selector button not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    async_with(async_playwright()) as playwright:
        await test_forecast_explorer_ui(playwright)
```

Make sure to create the `login_page.py` file in the `src/pages/` directory and implement the login functionality according to your application requirements. You can find more information about Playwright and how to use it with Python [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python).
