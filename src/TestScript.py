 I have created a new Python file named `TestScript.py` under the directory `src`. Here's the code for the script:

```python
# src/TestScript.py

import time
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, Page, browser

import pages.login_page as login_page

def test_forecast_explorer_ui():
    # Initialize the browser using Playwright
    with Playwright.create() as pw:
        browser = pw.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = browser.new_page()

        # Navigate to the login page
        login_page.go_to_login(page)

        # Login to the website (Assuming that login method is implemented in pages.login_page)
        login_page.login(page)

        # Click Feature Store Icon
        page.click('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')

        # Click Feature Store Text
        page.click('//span[normalize-space()="Feature Store"]')

        # Wait for Launch Feature Job button to be visible
        time.sleep(5)  # Adjust time based on page load time
        page.wait_for_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')

        # Click Launch Feature Job Button
        launch_feature_job_button = page.query_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')
        launch_feature_job_button.click()

        # Wait for Job Selector button to be visible
        time.sleep(5)  # Adjust time based on job selector load time
        page.wait_for_selector('button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq')

        # Verify the Job Selector button is visible
        job_selector = page.query_selector('button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq')
        assert job_selector is not None, "Job Selector button was not found"

    # Close the browser
    browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_forecast_explorer_ui()
```

Please note that this script assumes that there are classes named `LoginPage` in a file `pages/login_page.py` and it has an implemented method called `login`. Adjust the code accordingly based on your project structure and implementation details.

This code demonstrates how to use Playwright with Python to automate UI testing for a web application, using the given selectors and actions as examples. The test script logs into the website, navigates to the Feature Store page, clicks the Launch Feature Job button, waits for the Job Selector button to load, and verifies that the Job Selector button is visible.
