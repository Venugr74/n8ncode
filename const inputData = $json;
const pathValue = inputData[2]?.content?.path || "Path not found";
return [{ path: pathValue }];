 Here's an example of how you can structure your `TestScript.py` file in the given directory path (`src/TestScript.py`) using Python and Playwright to create an automated UI test for the specified web application features. I've made some assumptions about your project structure, which includes a `pages` folder containing a `login_page.py` file with a `LoginPage` class and login method.

```python
# src/TestScript.py

import time
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, async_playwright
from pages.login_page import LoginPage

class FeatureStoreTest:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        self.browser = browser
        self.page = browser.new_page()

    @staticmethod
    async def login():
        # Assuming you have a LoginPage class with a login method that takes no arguments
        login_page = LoginPage(await Playwright().start())
        await login_page.login()
        return login_page.browser

    async def test_forecast_explorer_ui(self):
        # Wait for the page to load completely before interacting with it
        await self.page.wait_for_load_state()

        # Click Feature Store Icon
        await self.page.click('span.sc-irPVuy.fYDalG')

        # Click Feature Store Text
        await self.page.click('//span[normalize-space()="Feature Store"]')

        # Wait for Launch Feature Job button to be visible
        await self.page.wait_for_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')

        # Click on Launch Feature Job Button
        launch_job_btn = await self.page.query_selector('(//button[normalize-space()="Launch Feature Job"])[1]')
        await launch_job_btn[0].click()

        # Wait for Job Selector button to be visible
        await self.page.wait_for_selector('button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq')

        # Verify the Job Selector button is visible
        job_selector = await self.page.query_selector('button.sc-blHHSb.dxiEPq')
        assert len(job_selector) > 0, "Job Selector button not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    async def main():
        # Start a Playwright browser instance with headless set to False
        browser = await async_playwright().start(headless=False)

        # Log in to the website using the login method from LoginPage
        await FeatureStoreTest(await login()).test_forecast_explorer_ui()

        # Close the browser when done
        await browser.close()

    main()
```

This script includes a `FeatureStoreTest` class that initializes a Playwright page, logs in to the web application using the provided `login` method from the `LoginPage`, and performs the specified UI tests on the Feature Store. The script waits for each element to be visible before interacting with it.

Make sure you have installed Playwright using:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Update your `pages/login_page.py` file accordingly if necessary, and don't forget to create the required folder structure for this script.
