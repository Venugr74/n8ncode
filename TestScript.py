 Here's an example of an automated UI test using Python, Playwright, and some of the provided details:

```python
import time
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

class BasePage:
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page

    async def navigate(self, url):
        await self.page.goto(url)

    async def login(self, email, password):
        sign_in_button = await self.page.query_selector("button:has-text('Sign in with AzureAD')")
        await sign_in_button.click()

        email_input = await self.page.query_selector("#i0116")
        password_input = await self.page.query_selector("#i0118")

        await email_input.fill(email)
        await password_input.fill(password)

        submit_button = await self.page.query_selector("#idSIButton9")
        await submit_button.click()

class ModelStorePage(BasePage):
    def __init__(self, page):
        super().__init__(page)

    async def is_validator_present(self):
        validator = await self.page.query_selector("span:text-contains('Forecast Explorer')")
        return validator is not None

async def test():
    browser = await async_playwright.start()
    page = await browser.new_page()
    model_store_page = ModelStorePage(page)

    # Navigate to the web application's login page
    await model_store_page.navigate("https://your-web-app-url/login")

    # Perform the login process
    await model_store_page.login("test@example.com", "password1234")

    time.sleep(5)  # Allow for the page to load after login

    # Verify that the validator is present, indicating successful login and access to the Model Store section
    assert await model_store_page.is_validator_present(), "The Model Store validator was not found."

    await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Test failed with error: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a simple test for the Model Store section of a web application, using Playwright and a `BasePage` class to simplify navigation and login functionality. The test navigates to the web application's login page, logs in using provided credentials, waits for the Model Store page to load, and then verifies that the validator is present on the page, indicating successful login and access to the desired section.

To run this script, make sure you have Playwright installed (`pip install playwright`) and execute the script with Python: `python test_model_store.py`. Keep in mind that you may need to modify the URL for your web application and any additional login credentials if they differ from what's provided in this example.
